Pedalboard2 ToDo
----------------
- Update to latest version of JUCE.
- Midi Output.
- OSC timeline of some kind.
	- Maybe generalisable, so it can do MIDI too?
- Visual output of some kind.
- Serial port input.
- Make sure the home key can be used by Application Mappings.
	- Viewport is currently grabbing it.
- Include the name of the current pdl file in the titlebar?
- Fix connection drawing so it doesn't mess up when drawing backwards.
- Plugin preset management:
	- Plugin preset next/prev commands which can be mapped to MIDI CCs and OSC
	  messages.
- Renaming the selected patch in Patch Organiser doesn't update the Patch:
  combobox's text.
- Hotkey to auto bypass all filters.
- Altering stuff via the Patch Organiser seems to screw things up sometimes.
- Fix AudioRecorder not always starting when triggered via MIDI->Main Transport.
- Snap to grid.
- Make sure Pedalboard starts minimized if it's been told to.
- Try a Linux version again.
- Check whether changing patches fast crashes on OSX.
- Make loadSVGFromMemory() a global helper function, not copy and pasted into
  every class that uses it.


- Improve plugin pins (temporarily enlarge them when the mouse is over them
  maybe).
- Make sure Audio Output is always at the right of the screen.
- No-setup record button.
- Router processor to replace Output Toggle.
	- 4 inputs, 4 outputs.
	- Lets the user toggle between two routing states (user-defined).
- MIDI/OSC messages sometimes ignored? There's some oddness happening, but it
  may be outside the app's control? Hard to debug :(
- 64-bit version for Windows.
- Update documentation.


- Make BypassableInstance a ChangeBroadcaster; switch PluginComponent over to
  being a ChangeListener instead of the timerUpdate() method.
- Replace Event Log TextEditor with ListBox.
- Make sure any cross-thread variables are Atomic.
- System Tray Component: Double-click should hide/show *all* windows.
- Make sure Metronome editors can't accept anything other than numbers
  (possible?).
- Zoom out mode/some way of reducing screen space taken up by plugin components
  & connections?
- 'Global' plugin field; doesn't change when you switch patches?
- Split PedalboardProcessors files into separate files for each processor.
- Current tempo display/editor is ugly - make it hidable?
- Move Misc Settings over to a PropertyPanel?
- Better add plugin method?
- Threading issues when deleting mappings?
- Switch over to a single Timer for all Internal processor Controls?
- Update BranchesLAF with custom sliders and toggle buttons?
- Zeroconf/bonjour support?
- Joystick/pad input?

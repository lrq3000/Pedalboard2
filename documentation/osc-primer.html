	<h2>Open Sound Control Primer</h2>

	<p>
		This page is intended as a quick explanation of the Open Sound Control
		protocol from a user's perspective. If you'd like more detail, see the
		official specification
		<a href="http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0">here</a>.

	<h2><a name="WhatIsOSC"></a>What is Open Sound Control?</h2>

	<p>
		Open Sound Control (hereafter abbreviated OSC) is a protocol designed
		for the transmission of musical control data. It is designed to serve a
		similar purpose to MIDI, albeit with a far less rigid definition of what
		constitutes musical control data. It is also a network protocol, meaning
		that it can be used to send data between computers, tablets, smartphones
		etc. Essentially, any device connected to your network can send and
		receive OSC data.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="WhatIsOSC"></a>Why use Open Sound Control?</h2>

	<p>
		OSC was designed to overcome the significant obstacles imposed by the
		continued use of the decades-old MIDI standard. Obstacles such as:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			MIDI data is limited to 7-bit words. This means that, for example,
			MIDI Control Change messages can only ever represent 128 discrete
			values. This can be particularly problematic when a MIDI controller
			is mapped to a filter cutoff, for example, where you will hear
			audible 'stepping' if the filter programmer did not add in some kind
			of interpolation. <em>(to be fair, the MIDI spec does allow for
			special 14-bit CC messages, but these are rarely implemented)</em>
		</li>
		<li>
			MIDI was designed with the Western musical scale in mind, and
			particularly, focused on keyboard instruments. It specifies 128
			discrete note values, and does not handle issues such as glissandi
			or alternate scales without complicated workarounds.
		</li>
		<li>
			MIDI uses a fixed 31.5kBaud transmission rate. This is painfully
			slow compared to today's hardware, and can lead to congestion when
			multiple MIDI devices are all transmitting/receiving data
			simultaneously.
		</li>
		<li>
			MIDI does not handle multiple input devices particularly well. In
			order for, e.g. multiple input devices to be connected to a single
			MIDI synthesizer, each input must be set to a unique channel, of
			which there may only be a maximum of 16. If more inputs are
			required, additional MIDI interfaces are required. 
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		OSC has none of these limitations.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="WhatDoINeedToKnow"></a>What do I Need to Know?</h2>

	<h3>IP Addresses and Ports</h3>

	<p>
		As a network protocol, OSC relies on IP addresses to identify where OSC
		messages should be sent. Basically, any device connected to your network
		has a unique IP address assigned to it. For an OSC client (the
		device/software which is transmitting OSC data) to send messages to an
		OSC server (the device/software which is receiving OSC data), it simply
		needs to know the IP address and port of the OSC server.
	</p>

	<p>
		Ports are a way of ensuring specific network data gets routed to the
		correct application for that data (e.g. webpage data is received on
		port 80). A port is just a 16-bit number. When sending/receiving OSC
		data, you can essentially pick an arbitrary port number, as long as it
		is greater than 1023 (numbers 0->1023 are reserved for various
		system uses).
	</p>

	<p>
		To summarise; an OSC server needs to be told to listen on a specific
		port; any OSC client that wants to communicate with that server will
		need to know the port the server is listening on, and the IP address
		of the device the server is running on.
	</p>

	<h3>OSC Addresses</h3>

	<p>
		Any data sent via OSC is sent alongside an OSC address. This is simply
		a piece of text that specifies what that data refers to. Essentially,
		a single OSC message looks something like this:
	</p>

	<pre>
/1/slider1 0.5
	</pre>

	<p>
		<em>/1/slider1</em> is the OSC address of the message, and <em>0.5</em>
		is the data of that message. For an application like the Pedalboard to
		then make use of this message, it needs to be told that any messages
		with the OSC address <em>/1/slider1</em> should be mapped to a
		particular plugin parameter or application function.
	</p>

	<p>
		All OSC devices and software transmit OSC messages like the above. One
		thing to note is that (to date) there is no agreed-upon standard
		regarding the naming of OSC addresses; an OSC address can be anything,
		as long as it starts with a forward-slash. Fortunately, the Pedalboard
		has a basic <a href="osc-mappings.html#OSCLearn">OSC learn</a> function
		which can be used to determine the OSC addresses used by any particular
		OSC client device.

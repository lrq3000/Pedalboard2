Pedalboard2 ChangeLog
---------------------

v2.14
-----
- Fixed BypassableInstance passing on MIDI messages that its plugin cleared.

v2.13
-----
- Fixed MIDI mapping latch option to work the way you'd expect it to.
- Fixed Audio Recorder deleting previously-recorded files if you re-loaded
  them and edited the path to select a new destination file.
- Added per-plugin MIDI channel filtering.
- Fixed pure virtual function call if the app receives a MIDI signal while
  it's closing.
- Implemented MIDI learn for plugin and application mappings.
- Plugin editor windows now take the plugin's user name as their title.
- Fixed Looper crashing/deadlocking sometimes when starting recording via MIDI
  (I hope; fingers crossed...).
- Fixed File Player loop parameter not being set when loaded from a patch.
- Length of the file is now drawn on the WaveformDisplay component (used by File
  Player, Looper, Audio Recorder).
- Fixed it so that File Player and Looper play buttons get updated when
  triggered via MIDI.
- Added Event Log to help when debugging MIDI and OSC issues.

v2.12
-----
- Fixed midi-producing plugins not passing their midi output on.
- Fixed it so the Looper won't crash if you hit record while it's already
  playing.
- Updated to JUCE v2.0.27.
- Fixed bug in JUCE's PluginDirectoryScanner causing previously-crashed plugins
  to get scanned repeatedly.

v2.11
-----
- Dragging a sound file onto the plugin field now automatically creates a File
  Player for it.
- Sound file thumbnails should now get reloaded when their file changes.
- Fixed Audio Recorder refusing to overwrite existing files and providing no
  explanation as to why.
- Added support for MIDI over OSC using the ',m' type tag.
- Added support for MIDI over OSC as a triplet of ints or floats.
- Fixed Audio Recorder not recording because it was unable to find a samplerate.
- Fixed an assert when trying to add an OSC mapping for a plugin which doesn't
  give all its parameters names.
- Keypress mapping dialog no longer cuts off text (don't know why this suddenly
  started working :/ ).
- Moved delete filter button to top left, to make room for bypass button in its
  old position.
- Added toggle option to force fixed-size plugin editor windows.
- Added a Looper processor.
- Added bypass button for all filters.
- Added support for multiple values in an OSC message (i.e. with something like
  '/oscAddress 0.0 0.5 1.0' you can now select which of the three values you're
  actually interested in).
- Fixed shift-stereo connection for filters with greater than 2 outputs.
- Added store audio settings in .pdl files option.

v2.10
-----
- Fixed MIDI program change only ever switching to the first patch
  (OSX-specific?).

v2.09
-----
- Fix MIDI program change to work with individual patch numbers.
- Added initial plugin preset functionality; presets can be altered and renamed,
  and are saved with patches.
- Added user presets for plugins. Presets saved by the user will automatically
  get added on to the plugin's list of presets, and can be loaded via the same
  interface used to load the plugin's internal presets.
- Added User Preset Management window, where you can rename, copy, delete,
  import and export user presets.
- Added a popup box when MIDI program change is used to switch patches and an
  out of bounds index is received.
- Added basic metronome component.
- Added file playback to metronome component.
- Fixed the 'are you sure?'-on-quit dialog popping up even if the user made no
  changes to the loaded file.
- Added the option of running the app in the system tray (Windows & Linux only).
- Fixed the 'are you sure?'-on-quit dialog popping up even if the user made no
  changes to the loaded file (when the file was loaded from the command line).
- Added documentation (via browser) link to Help Menu.
- AudioUnit parameter changes now show up in plugin editors.

v2.08
-----
- Changed MIDI->Application mappings to use a lock-free FIFO, making deadlocks
  impossible (hopefully).
- Altered tap tempo calculation: now takes the average of the last 4 taps.
- Tap tempo via MIDI and OSC is now calculated from their respective threads
  rather than the main message thread; this *should* be more accurate.
- Changed OSC->Application mappings to use the same lock-free FIFO as the MIDI
  mappings.
- Now pops up an 'Are you sure?' dialog box if you quit without saving the
  current patch.
- Fixed bug with Patch Organiser inserting bogus patches if you did File->New
  and had anything but the first patch selected when you did it.
- Fixed *extremely* stupid bug with the Output Toggle; it was sheer coincidence
  that it worked (or appeared to work) at all.
- Main Transport should be more robust with regard to Audio Recorders.

v2.07
-----
- Fixed the app not running on OSX 10.5.
- Fixed issue where the app would deadlock if you tried to change patch via MIDI
  before it had finished loading the current patch.

v2.06
-----
- Custom plugin names are now updated when patches are loaded.
- Fixed patch changing via MIDI (& OSC?) not working when the main window is
  not focused.
- Made sure patches saved pre-2.05 do not place plugin windows outside the
  screen.
- Patch Organiser move commands now update the selected row more sensibly.
- Added option to have main transport respond to MMC commands.
- Fixed some dialogs not taking on the colour scheme's window background colour.
- Added toggle to switch patches via MIDI program change commands.
- Fixed connections being drawn wrong when plugin names have been changed.
- Fixed plugins' edited names persisting between patches.
- Made sure connections stay behind plugin components once connected.
- Added global tempo per patch. This is solely for the benefit of delay plugins
  etc. which can make use of it to set sensible delay times. It is not a full
  implementation of VST (etc.) time info structures. Plugins which require
  information about bar starts, current ppq etc. are out of luck. Until I've
  figured out how the app itself conceives of time those features are not going
  to be added.
- Can now hold shift while dragging a connection to automatically connect all
  audio connections between the two plugins.
- Can set tempo by tapping (either via a GUI control or via a
  keyboard/MIDI CC/OSC command: see the Application Mappings window).
- Refactored creation of mappings so they don't register themselves in their
  constructors.
- Added 'Save as Default file' option (current file saved as 'default.pdl'
  inside the Pedalboard2 settings folder (<user>/AppData/Roaming/Pedalboard2 on
  Windows, <user>/Library/Application Support/Pedalboard2 on OSX)).

v2.05
-----
- Plugin file drag and drop no longer creates multiple instances (JUCE bug).
- Can now drag and drop plugin files to the Available Plugins window (JUCE bug).
- Audio Input and Midi Input toggles now save state.
- Updated File->New etc. descriptions.
- Fixed crash when trying to load a .pdl file with Midi/Osc Inputs disabled.
- Fixed disabled Midi/Osc Inputs screwing up patch loading.
- Added plugin window Always On Top toggle to Misc Settings.
- Fixed plugin renaming incorrectly resizing the Plugin Component.
- Added "Ignore plugin pin names" option to Misc Settings.
- Moved over to the new modular version of JUCE.
- Fixed plugin field scrolling behaviour.
- Changing audio settings no longer requires a reload to get all the
  input/output pins to show up.
- Plugin window position is now saved.
- Plugin window open/closed state is now saved.
- Can no longer connect audio connections to parameter pins and vice versa.

v2.04
-----
- Display the app's own icon in its titlebar.
- New icon.
- Wrote my own showModalDialog() method, so all the various child windows
  can share the main app's icon for their titlebars.
- Fixed Application Mappings dialog not saving changes (oops!).
- Added tooltips.
- Added support for custom colour schemes, including colour scheme editor.
- Made it possible to have inverted MIDI mappings.
- Removed GraphEditorPanel dependency.
- Fixed plugins opening blank guis on OSX.
- Fixed preferences files being saved in the wrong location on OSX.

v2.03
-----
- Drag and drop loading of .pdl files.
- Drag and drop loading of plugin files (.dll, .vst, .component).
- Set FilePlayer's Sync to Main Transport button correctly on creation.
- Saving an existing patch should no longer open the save as... dialog.
- Dragging a PluginComponent outside the PluginField's bounds scrolls the
  viewport.
- Fixed Midi Input only accepting messages from the default device; now messages
  from any devices ticked in the Audio Settings dialog will be available.
- Special case fix for VAZ+, since it doesn't like being put in a resizable
  window.
- Basic OSC learn functionality; the app remembers every OSC address it's been
  sent since it was started, and gives the user a combobox list of them.
- Added the same OSC learn functionality to application mappings window.
- Fixed memory leak in the mappings managers.
- Larger hit test area for plugin pins (big enough now?).
- Fixed plugins disappearing off the top left of the screen if you dragged
  them and changed patch.
- Made AudioFormatManager and AudioThumbnailCache singletons to simplify
  things (not ideal, but the alternative would be an enormous pain in the
  bum).
- Added Audio Recorder component.
- Use same stored folder for AudioRecorder as for FilePlayer.

v2.02
-----
- Load pdl files from the command line.

v2.01
-----
- Display the current computer's IP address in the about window.
- Add Trigger parameter to File Player (to allow drum machine-style playing).
- Make OSC mapping address text editor not require a return keypress.
- Draw dragged connections centred on the mouse pointer.
- Update PluginField bounds when a processor is moved outside them.
- Made Level processor stereo.
- VU Meter processor.
- Ability to double-click a processor's title bar to change its name.
- Give pins a larger hit test radius when dragging a connection.
- Make sure 'Override plugin's MIDI...' button state persists after closing the
  window.
- Update to JUCE v1.54.27.
